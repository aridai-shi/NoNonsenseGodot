            <h2>Introduction to Scenes and Nodes</h2>
            <p>Nodes are the basic building blocks of a Godot project. Different parts of the game world will often be made up of several different Nodes. Some will be responsible for collision, others for visual effects, physics handling, etc. Their class
                (ex. KinematicBody2D, TextureProgress, CollisionShape) will determine their built-in functions and properties, streamlining programming by using the right Node for the right job (ex. KinematicBody2D has a <samp>move_and_slide()</samp>                function that lets' it move around while accounting for collision). Nodes are ordered in a tree structure - when Node A is put under Node B in the structure, we say Node A is Node B's <b>child Node</b>. Child Nodes inherit some of their
                properties from their parent Nodes (ex. position, rotation, scale), only being able to change them in relation to their parents.

            <p class="subtitle">In the left picture, Node B is Node A's sibling. In the right pic Node B is Node A's child. Know the difference!</p>
            <p>Child Nodes are also used by parent Nodes as components (ex. an Area2D Node using a CollisionShape2D child Node for collision). To use a child Node within the parent's script, use <samp>$ChildNodeName</samp>.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="subtitle">EXAMPLE: To mess with the <samp>HandSprite</samp> Node from <samp>Player</samp>'s script, you gotta call <samp>$HandArea/HandSprite</samp>.</p>
            <p>Scenes are just Nodes saved as files. You can copy-paste the Scene all around a project, and when you change the Scene's file directly, the changes will be applied to all instances of said Scene immediately.</p>

                <video src="vid/example-scenes.mp4" controls loop muted class="shadow-box video"></video>
            </div>
            <p class="subtitle">EXAMPLE: By moving the CollisionShape2D in <samp>Player.tscn</samp>, we've affected all versions of it throughout the game.</p>
            <p>The ability to make tons of copies of different Node setups without clogging up the tree and to change the object once instead of manually changing each copy makes Scenes an essential tool for any Godot game developer.</p>
            <p>While this is a pretty basic tutorial for this website, many people have requested one on this subject.</p>
